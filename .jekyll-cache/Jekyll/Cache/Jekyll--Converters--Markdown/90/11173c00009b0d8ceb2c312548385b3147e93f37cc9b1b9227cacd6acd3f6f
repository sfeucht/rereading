<p class="quote">The whole idea that legalizing marijuana generates more revenue is the thesis of a <em>retard</em>. Thereâ€™s much more money to be made off an illegal substance that is worth as much as gold, and can be spun out of thin air if you have land and power. Retards donâ€™t see a tax on it, so they think legalizing it somehow creates wealth.</p>

<!-- Police profile because it makes their jobs easier, i.e. they are being lazy. In the case of stop and frisk, very few illegal weapons have actually been seized, which was the whole justification for the program in the first place. Most of the arrests are for misdemeanor amounts of marijuana and all racial groups use drugs, especially marijuana, at similar levels. -->
